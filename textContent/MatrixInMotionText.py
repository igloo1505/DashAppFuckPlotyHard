matrixSliderText = '''Describing the motion of a boat through wind of some velocity equivalent $\large{\\frac{\epsilon}{\\vartheta}}$, the surface plot above shows the supplied $Force$ by this matrix on the observer as that observer deviates from traveling at a *maximal achievable rate* along axis $\epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ represents the direction of this matrix flow and $\lambda$ represents flow perfectly perpendicular to that of $\epsilon$. In this context, *maximal achievable rate* represents the rate achievable given a set of environmental conditions including the total resistance applied to the observer, the combined energy of the matrix at the position of the observer, and the geometric-technological means the observer has of capturing this energy. No matter the velocity of the encompassing matrix, the interval as plotted and the associated $\max{\\alpha}$ can be described in the following manner:
>
> $\Large{\\begin{equation} \max \int_{\\normalsize{\lambda=0}}^{\\normalsize{\lambda=\epsilon}} \\frac{\epsilon^2 + \lambda^2}{\epsilon^2 + (\lambda^2(\\frac{\lambda^2}{\epsilon^2}))} = \\frac{\sqrt{2} - 1}{2} + 1  \end{equation}}$
> 
This is to say that while a boat's *maximum achievable distance* resolves to $\sqrt{2} * \epsilon$, and $\Delta\epsilon = \Delta\lambda$, the maximum derivable force, $\max{\\alpha}$, from this matrix is equal to $(\\frac{\sqrt{2} - 1}{2} + 1) * \epsilon$. It is interesting to not the symmetries between this maximum achievable force and $\Phi$, derived as $\\frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}$, even if the mathematical and physical implications aren't immediately obvious.
